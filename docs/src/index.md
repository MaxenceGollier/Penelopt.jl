ExactPenalty.jl is a software package for large-scale, equality-constrained, [nonlinear programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_programming).
It is designed to find (local) solutions of mathematical optimization problems of the form
```math
    \underset{x \in \mathbb{R}^n}{\textup{minimize}} \ f(x) \quad \textup{subject to} \ c(x) = 0,
```
where $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ and $c : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$ are the objective and the constraint function, respectively.
Both $f$ and $c$ can be nonlinear and nonconvex but they are assumed to be continuously differentiable.
Moreover, it is assumed that $m \leq n$.

Our solver is based on the exact [penalty method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_method).
It consists in transforming the equality-constrained problem above into a sequence of unconstrained penalized problems
```math
    \underset{x \in \mathbb{R}^n}{\textup{minimize}} \ f(x) + \tau_k g(c(x)).
```
where $\tau_k > 0$ is the penalty parameter and $g$ is the penalty function.
In this package, we use $g = \|\cdot\|_2$.

## Main Features

On a practical level, the package uses the standardized [NLPModels.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/NLPModels.jl) API to represent the non-linear programming (NLP) problem. If you want to figure out how to interface your NLP problem with [NLPModels.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/NLPModels.jl), we refer to their [documentation](https://jso.dev/NLPModels.jl/stable/).

!!! note "Using Other Modelling Languages"
    If your NLP is represented in one of the following formats/sets, no worries, you can easily use our solver!
    * [AMPL](https://ampl.com/wp-content/uploads/BOOK.pdf): Use [AmplNLReader.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/AmplNLReader.jl). You should read [this tutorial](tutorials/AMPL.md).
    * [JuMP](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/): Use [NLPModelsJuMP.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/NLPModelsJuMP.jl). You should read [this tutorial](tutorials/JuMP.md).
    * [CUTEst](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10589-014-9687-3): Use [CUTEst.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/CUTEst.jl). You should read [this tutorial](tutorials/CUTEst.md).

Once the problem has been modeled, you can simply install ExactPenalty.jl and solve your problem! 🚀
```{julia}
# Interface your problem with the NLPModels.jl API
julia> nlp = ...

# Install
julia> using Pkg
julia> Pkg.add("ExactPenalty")
julia> using ExactPenalty

# Solve
julia> L2Penalty(nlp)
```
The example above uses the solver with its default settings.
ExactPenalty.jl also provides a variety of [options](options.md) for customizing the optimization process, and returns a [result object](outputs.md) containing the computed solution together with diagnostic information. 📖

For more advanced use cases, you can monitor or customize the optimization process through [callbacks](callbacks.md). 🔧

Finally, if performance is critical, you can find tips in the [performance section](performance.md). ⚡

!!! note "Choosing A Linear Solver Library"
    Our algorithm solves multiple [linear systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_linear_equations).
    By default, the linear system solver we use is [LDLFactorizations.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/LDLFactorizations.jl).
    Our solver is interfaced with the following solvers too:
    * [MUMPS](https://mumps-solver.org/index.php?page=doc): you should read [this tutorial](tutorials/MUMPS.md) to use it.
    * [HSL-MA57](https://www.hsl.rl.ac.uk/catalogue/ma57.html): you should read [this tutorial](tutorials/HSL.md) to use it.
